# 💎 Diamond Template

A modular, upgradeable smart contract framework built using the [EIP-2535 Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). This template provides a clean foundation for building composable and gas-efficient smart contracts with facet-based architecture.

---

## 📦 Features

- ⚙️ **Facets**: Modular smart contract logic components
- 🔁 **Upgradeable**: Add, replace, or remove functions at runtime
- 🧪 **Foundry test suite**: Includes deployment and mutation tests
- 🔍 **Loupe Functions**: Introspect facet addresses and selectors
- 👑 **Role-based Access Control** via `OwnableRolesFacet`
- 📚 **ERC165 Interface Support**
- 🚀 **Automated Deploy Script**

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Forge install this repo

```sh
forge install dadadave80/diamond-lib
```

2. Import the Diamond contract and facets into your project
```solidity
import {Diamond} from "@diamond/Diamond.sol";
import {DiamondCutFacet} from "@diamond/facets/DiamondCutFacet.sol";
import {DiamondLoupeFacet} from "@diamond/facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol";
import {OwnableRolesFacet} from "@diamond/facets/OwnableRolesFacet.sol";
```

3. Run Tests

```sh
forge test --ffi -vvv
```

4. Deploy Locally

```sh
forge script script/DeployDiamond.s.sol --fork-url <RPC_URL> --broadcast
```
